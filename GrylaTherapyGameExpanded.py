DOCUMENTATION
Written in Notepad++, Tested in Powershell & Command Prompt
Only major difference using IDLE is that the console won't clear from os.system('clr')

For the fight, how I interpret it: 20 or more (5%, or 10% with table item) is a hit so powerful that you defeat Gryla right then and there.
1 or less (since you cannot get a negative modifier for the fight specifically (and the other possiblities don't have crit fail conditions) is considered a "heal" turn for Grylda, which will bring her back to 2 hp (each hit is 1 hp)
The 'heal turn' causes a requirement of >= 3 hits, and is a lot more sensical to implement (Otherwise, crit fail activates only once? That's not ineresting at all).
    Also, Gr每la doesn't attack on heal turns, to make them a little more fair if the player has REALLY bad luck.
So, treating it like this give the player a net benefit, and since critical conditions don't exist for other fight actions, it otherwise doesn't matter.
EXTRA NOTE: Actually, since it's possible to have either +0 or +1, it may be impossible to crit fail. SO, instead, crit fails work off of the unmodified roll, but crit successes are still with modifiers.
