You are in a small, smoke-laden room.
A musty & moldy stench permetaes the room,
eminanting from a mixture of old, discarded scraps and aging woodwork.
A small fire smolders in the hearth in the corner. Someone has been here recently.
A dark staircase in the corner leads downward, presumably to a storage room.
