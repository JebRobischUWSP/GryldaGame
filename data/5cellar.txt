You descend into an old cellar.
Barrels and bushels of old vegeatbles and herbs rest along the walls, or what you can make out of them.

Suddenly, a figure leaps out from the darkness:
Gr√øla!

A witchy, crooked, cruel hermit stares you down with evil intent.
Her breath is raggedy, but her fierceness shows through;
she knows you fear her, and she intends to use that to her gain.

You need to act, FAST!
