You're in a large, barely lit room.
A single messy table fills most of the left side, but the room is otherwise bare and dusty.
Two windows peer out from the porch, giving a sullen view of the dark forest.
Opposing the windows on the back wall of the room are two doors.
An occasional flicker of warm light slips past the edges of the left door (Room 3).
The right door (Room 4) is eerily dark and quiet.
