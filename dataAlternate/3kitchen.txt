You are in a small, smoke-laden room.
A delicate aroma fills the air, a mixture of alchemic compounds and homemade stew.
A small fire smolders in the hearth in the corner, proof of your successful ever-lit-hearth charm. A cauldron sits atop it, devoid of any mixtures.
A dark staircase in the corner leads downward, to your cellar. Most of the noise seems to be coming from there. Wonder why?
