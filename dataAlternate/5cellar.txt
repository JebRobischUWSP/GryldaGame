You descend into your cold-storage cellar.
Barrels and bushels of old vegeatbles and herbs rest along the walls, alongside flasks of various tinctures.
Suddenly, a figure leaps out triumphantly from the darkness:
That damned Adventurer!

A haugty, well-built, seasoned explorer boasts their presence in front of you, goading without lifting a lip.
Their face is twisted in a wicked smirk, their pose dripping with narcissism.
"Begone, you foul wench! This land would be much greater without your wicked evil tainting this grand forest!"

The adventurer prepares to strike. You need to act, FAST!
