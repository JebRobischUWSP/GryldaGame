You are in your cold-storage cellar.
Barrels and bushels of old vegeatbles and herbs rest along the walls, alongside flasks of various tinctures; mostly failed ones, but that's just how alchemy goes sometimes. Maybe they'll be useful later.

Where a haughty figure once stood now lies a crumpled figure, groaning with one of the cruel pains you manged to inflict in battle. Their pockets have been successfully raided of your key.

Stairs lead back up behind you. No use staying down here; you have belongings to secure!
