You are in an old cellar.
Barrels and bushels of old vegeatbles and herbs rest along the walls, or what you can make out of them.

Where a wicked figure once stood now sits a small pile of dust with the imprint of a key.

Stairs lead back up behind you. It's probably in your best interest to get out of here.
