You have successfully defeated the Adventurer and have taken back your beloved hut!

Your chest (thankfully) still contains:
  Gr√øla's Potion of Protection
    For 24 hours after consumption, the drinker 
    gains +1 to their AC and all saving throws.
  25 Gold Pieces

Additionally, you gained 1/2 level of EXP! If you took the time to have a pleasant chat with "Mamo Nag: The Bully", you can mark yourself as being level 2. Surprising you haven't gotten more XP yet, honestly.


You Win!
